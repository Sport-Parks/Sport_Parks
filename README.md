## Overview
### Description
This app will be a sports app, called Sport Parks, that shows all sports specific parks that are in certain areas. Once you find the one you want to go to you can then find other people who are going to that same park and have a chance contacting them through the app to see if other athletes would like to train with you and at what time and on what day as well. This could be helpful for people who especially don't have coaches or need to find a place that fits their needs for whatever sport they need to train for.
